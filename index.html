       Alfred's Cause for Taking the CSC 160
  </h1>
  <p>
    My majors are econ and IST, and my future goal is to work in financial area, espcially working in an investment bank or 
    being a consultant or analyst. Therefore, it would be super useful for me to learn sth about data science. I didn't 
    acknowledge that before because originally I was not a fan of cs. However, there were various circumstances, whatever 
    in my econ research or in my intern, that required me to have such skill to analyze the data, the number. Then, I started 
    to realize the importance of it.
